## Information Problem
Before now, there has not been an efficient way of documenting litter pickup around PG County. So for our application, we set to create a website with a form for users to input any litter they find around PG County + a heatmap to visualize the litter thatâ€™s been logged.

## Identified Stakeholders & Target Browsers
### Stakeholders:
- PG County Residents
- Environmental Activists
### Target Browsers:
- Chrome 81+
- Firefox 76+

Currently untested for other browsers (Edge, Safari, w3m, etc.)

## Dataset

## Strategies and Solutions
???

## Technical System Decision Rationale

- SQLite Database
  - Used for embedded storage of our data in the back end of our system
- Heatmap (with leaflet.js)
  - Used for presentation of our data in the form of a heatmap. Has zooming capabilities and allows for data to update when submissions are added.
- Data fetched from PG County Open Data API
  - The base of our data, however we moved this data to be embedded within our SQLite.
- Bulma.io CSS Framework
  - Used as the foundation of our CSS to enhance our application with a smooth and consistent finish.
- Tests using Cypress.js and Mocha
  - Used for reliable and flexible testing for browser based applications.

## How the final system addresses the problem

## Challenges

## Future Work

- Expand target area
  - Possibly include more counties if datasets exist.
- Add a filter
  - Additional functionality for the heat-map to show trash collected by litter type.
