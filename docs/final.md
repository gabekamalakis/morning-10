## Information Problem
Before now, there has not been an efficient way of documenting litter pickup around PG County. So for our application, we set to create a website with a form for users to input any litter they find around PG County + a heatmap to visualize the litter thatâ€™s been logged.

## Identified Stakeholders & Target Browsers
### Stakeholders:
- PG County Residents
- Environmental Activists
### Target Browsers:
- Chrome 81+
- Firefox 76+

Currently untested for other browsers (Edge, Safari, w3m, etc.)
