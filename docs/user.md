# LitterLog User Manual

This application was created by the Morning 10 Project group in order to provide PG County Residents and environmental activists with a dependable and consistent way to log and keep track of litter. This application contains two main parts, the map and the submission form.

## The Litter Logger Heat-map

This map is a visualization of all of the litter currently logged in our database. By using the zoom features, a user can navigate PG County, and look at the concentration of logged litter.

## The Litter Logger Submission Form

This submission form is the way to add new data to the database and to the heat-map. When out for a walk, if a user sees any litter and decides to log it, they can fill out this form with the relevant information. They can enter their personal information, and also information about the litter, such as its location, the time of logging, and the type/amount of litter being logged.
